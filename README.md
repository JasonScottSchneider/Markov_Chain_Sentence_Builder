# Markov_Chain_Sentence_Builder
<p>This is a program to build random sentences based on the data with sentences fed into it. This program uses simple Markov chains that checks at every one, two, or three words, depending on how many Markov chains a user desires running.</p>
<p>The novel of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein has been provided to model Markov chains so that the program can generate however many sentences a user selects, but a user can try any text file with any content desired to generate sentences with this program.</p>
